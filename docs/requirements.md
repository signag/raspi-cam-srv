# Requirements

[![Up](img/goup.gif)](./getting_started_overview.md)

- A **Raspberry Pi** ([Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), [Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/), [Pi 1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/), [Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/), [Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/))
- A [Raspberry Pi camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html)
- A suitable **camera cable** <br>(Pi Zero W, Pi Zero 2 W and Pi 5 have the small CSI-2 camera port, requiring a special cable which is usually not shipped with the camera)
- A **microSD card**
- A suitable **power supply**<br>For Pi Zero W or Pi Zero 2 W, a normal mobile phone charger is sufficient as long as it has a Micro-USB connector
- Optionally, a **case** for the specific model may ease handling.<br>For Pi Zero W or Zero 2 W, offerings for the official case (e.g. [here](https://www.reichelt.de/gehaeuse-fuer-raspberry-pi-zero-rot-weiss-rpiz-case-whrd-p223607.html?PROVID=2788&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2JfM3vjcgwMVSxYGAB1pSQBOEAYYASABEgL_GPD_BwE)) should include a special short (38 mm) camera cable.<br>The cover for the camera is fine for camera models 1 and 2. For camera model 3, some handwork is necessary to enlarge the hole to a square for the camera body.<br>Alternatively, there are various 3D printable variants, e.g. [Case for Raspberry Pi Zero Models with Camera](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1804527-case-for-raspberry-pi-zero-models-with-camera#profileId-1924557).
- A **Wifi network** with internet access and known access credentials (**SSID**, **password**)
- A **PC or Mac** with network access and **(micro)SD** card reader

The [setup description](./system_setup.md), assumes a completely autonomous or 'headless' setup, where the Raspberry Pi requires nothing but a power supply cable without any necessity to ever connect it to a display, keyboard or mouse.
