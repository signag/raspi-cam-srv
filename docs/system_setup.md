# System Setup for raspiCamSrv

[![Up](img/goup.gif)](./getting_started_overview.md)

Follow the instructions of the [Raspberry Pi Getting Started Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#get-raspberry-pi-os) for OS installation using [Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager).   

**NOTE**: It is **strongly** recommended to install the Debian distribution recommended by [Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#raspberry-pi-imager) for your Raspberry Pi device. This is usually the full 64-bit version including desktop.     
Lite versions usually miss essential parts of the software stack required by **raspiCamSrv**.    

Make sure that SSH is enabled on the Services tab.

Once the SD card is written, insert it into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.   
Initially, it will take several minutes until it is visible in the network.
